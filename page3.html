            <h3>favicons</h3>
            the little icon at the top in the tab is called a favicon.
            <hr>
            <h3>divs</h3>
            a div devides up the page and has things put in it.
            It changes shape to fit the content.
            They have margines set by the browser which can be overided.
            <hr>
            <h3>borders</h3>
            As everything is a box ypu can also set the border tof the box's
            width. you can do each side separately if necesary
            padding is space between the border and text.
        </p>

            positioning
        </h1>
        <p>
            <h3>display</h3>
            block elements take up the whole width of the page.
            inline display elements only take the nescesaruy space in height and width
            useful for highlighting certain things but you can't change the width
            can change display values directly with css
            inline-block can have width canged and lets others on the same line 
            <hr>
            <h3> absolute</h3>
            an absolute position is where the position is relative to the parent object 
            not the presumed positipn the location is the distance from the direction 
            stated's border. <div class="Blue"></div>
            this moves to 90% of the whole p tag.
            When using absolute positioning the other objects can move into the presumed 
            place (no place holder is made) as can be seen
            <hr>
            <h3>realative</h3>
            in relative positioning the direction is the same as absolute but the refference
            is the presumed position so this moves 30 pixles left of itself not left of the
            whole screen
            <div class="red"></div>
            we also see it stops other objects from replacing it leaving a "ghost"
            <hr>
            <h3>fixed</h3>
            stays at the same place in the website regardless of if scrolled or anything
            <hr>
            <h3> alignment</h3>
            if a roperty is block displayed or any other 100% width option it can be alined
            using the parent objects text-aline property
            <br>
            if not then use margine:auto but only auto for the desired margines
            ie for centre width but not height you want 0 top auto left 0 bottom
            auto right and you can just list them in order without the direction
            to centre align
        </p>
