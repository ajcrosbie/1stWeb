        <h3> forms </h3>
        <p> a form allows a seried of inputs to be made
            the action is used to say what to do with those inputs
            the submit calls this action it can be filled with an
            mailTo:fake@email to send the data to that. 
            it is then filled with input object which can
            be made into vastly different types using the
            type paramiter.
            the name paramiter will pass that along with the
            inputed data when sent to the next part of the program
            very usefull to give context and manage things

        <h3> CSS summary</h3>
        <p> 
            everything is basicaly in a box so that box can be styled
            <br>
            the general best practive for css is to put it into a separate file
            this applies it across every linked page but it creates global changes
            <br>
            this can be overruled by an individual assighnment in the tag.
            To just target certain objects create a class for them advanced
            use <span class="exampleClass">."ClassName"{} </span>to affect them in the external field
            or use an id and to affect that use <span id="exampleId">#"IdName"{}</span>
            <span class="exampleClass">Classes</span> overide whole tag instences as do
            <strong>IDs</strong> 
            <br>
            <strong> IDs</strong> overide <i class="exampleClass">Classes</i>
            <br>
            <span class="exampleClass">Classes</span> can be put on multiple objects whereas <stong>
            IDs</stong> can't. 
            <br>
            to put multiple <span class="exampleClass">classes</span> on an object use class="className1 ClassName2"
            <br>
            the browser has internal expectations that are overwritten through css
            <br>
            psudo classes are used when an object is in a certain state for example being moused over
            <br>
            <img class ="hoverableImage" src="diamond-clipart-transparent-2-transparent.png">
